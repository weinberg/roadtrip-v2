RoadTrip is a low intensity casual multiplayer background game requiring little interaction and can be played at your own pace while working or doing other activities.

## Current State

What comes before Alpha? Currently you can run the server and client and create a car which will travel from Seattle to Denver. No fancy features exist yet.

## Design

![System components](design/diagram.png?raw=true "System Components")

RoadTrip is a client server application with the following components:

**GameClient** - Terminal application written in Go. Talks GraphQL to the API server. Displays the text UI.

**API Server** - GraphQL server written in typescript, apollo, prisma. Delegates some queries to the GameServer using gRPC.

**GameServer** - Go gRPC microservice to update live world data. Periodically persists state to postgres db via prisma.

**Database** - Postgres

The client is written in Go for cross-platform support. The API server is written in node/typescript with a postgres database and prisma. The server parts are built to run in containers using either Kubernetes or Docker Compose.
